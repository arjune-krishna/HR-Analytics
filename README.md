## HR Analytics:

Human resources (HR) is the division of a business that is charged with finding, screening, recruiting, and training job applicants. It also administers employee-benefit programs.

HR plays a key role in helping companies deal with a fast-changing business environment and a greater demand for quality employees in the 21st century.

I've built a dashboard for the HR department where they can get a summary of each department and each employee in the organization.

## Objective
### Department Page - (Page 1)
> <b>"Select a Department" Dropdown Menu:</b>
We're presented with the option to select the department for analysis from a list of departments in the organizations.
- `Customer Service`
- `Development`
- `Finance`
- `Human Resources`
- `Marketing`
- `Production`
- `Quality Management`
- `Research`
- `Sales`

> <b>Active Employees:</b> Gives us the total number of active employees in the organization

> <b>Median Salary:</b> Calculates the median salary of all the employees in the department

> <b>Department Salary in %:</b> `(Total Salary Paid to All The Employees in the Department / Total Salary) * 100`

> <b>Employees Gender (in %):</b> % of Male and Female Employees in the Department ("Doughnut Chart")

> <b>Average Hike vs Working Year:</b> YoY Average Hike in Salary of all the Employees in the Department ("Line Chart")

> <b>Churn Rate per Year:</b> % of Employees churning each year. ("Line Chart")

> <b>Employee's Experience When Churned:</b> Average Employees Experience (in yrs) when churned. ("Bar Chart")

</br>

### Employee Page - (Page 2)

> <b>Department:</b> Department of the employee

> <b>Date of Birth:</b> Date of Birth of the employee

> <b>Current Salary:</b> Current Salary of the employee
